# Developer guide

This guide is intended for new Menhir developers, and should explain how
things work.

For the moment, there is not much information in it.

## Build Instructions

There are two ways of recompiling Menhir after making a change in the sources.

To perform a single compilation pass, just go down into the `src` directory
and type `make`. This produces an executable file named `_build/install/default/bin/menhir`.

To go further and check that Menhir can process its own grammar,
still in the `src` directory,
type `make bootstrap`.

`make bootstrap` occasionally fails for no good reason. In that case,
use `make clean` before attempting `make bootstrap` again.

## Testing

To run Menhir's test suite, just go down into the `test` directory
and type `make test`. The package `functory` is required; install
it first via `opam install functory`.

The subdirectory `test/good` contains a number of correct `.mly` files.
The test suite checks that Menhir accepts these files and
compares the output of `menhir --only-preprocess` against an expected output.
It does not check that Menhir actually produces a working parser.

The subdirectory `test/bad` contains a number of incorrect `.mly` files.
The test suite checks that Menhir rejects these files
and produces the expected error message.

Some performance and correctness checks can be found in the directory `quicktest`;
see [quicktest/README](quicktest/README).

## About the Module Ordering

Some toplevel modules have side effects and must be executed in the
following order:

| Module                | Task |
| --------------------- | ---- |
| Settings              | parses the command line |
| PreFront              | reads the grammar description files |
| TokenType             | deals with `--only-tokens` and exits |
| Front                 | deals with `--depend`, `--infer`, `--only-preprocess`, and exits |
| Grammar               | performs a number of analyses of the grammar |
| Lr0                   | constructs the LR(0) automaton |
| Slr                   | determines whether the grammar is SLR |
| Lr1                   | constructs the LR(1) automaton |
| Conflict              | performs default conflict resolution and explains conflicts |
| Invariant             | performs a number of analyses of the automaton |
| Interpret             | deals with `--interpret` and exits |
| Back                  | produces the output and exits |

A few artificial dependencies have been added in the code in order
to ensure that this ordering is respected by `ocamlbuild`.
